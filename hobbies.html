    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        Appart from taking my time, on expanding my knowledge and vision in the sphere of programming and engineering,
        I love to read books and drawing. I would also love to expand my horizon and tap in differen things such as 
        playing an instrument or some physical activities such a specific sport. Although I go to the gym I do not
        consider it a hobby but a part of my daily life now. <br />
        I have had played video games before and although I do not spend as much as time as before or not at all,
        I do sometimes enjoy play something that I am interested or play games with my friends. Video games has been 
        a big part of my childhood and it has been a core part of me wanting to continue in the filed of engineering and
        programming.
